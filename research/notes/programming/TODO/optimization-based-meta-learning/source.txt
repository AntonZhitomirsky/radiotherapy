Optimization-based Meta-Learning. Optimization-based
meta-learning techniques often learn representations that
minimize downstream fine-tuning steps by using a few ex-
amples per task, sometimes referred to as few-shot learn-
ing [ 22 , 75 , 100 , 94 ]. Meta-learning via fine-tuning has been
studied in medical image segmentation to handle multiple im-
age modalities [ 105 ], anatomies [ 103 ], and generalization to
different targets [48, 49 , 93 ]. While these strategies reduce
the amount of data and training required for downstream
tasks [30 ], fine-tuning these models nevertheless requires
machine learning expertise and computational resources,
which are often not available to medical researchers.
