Multi-task Learning. Multi-Task Learning (MTL) frame-
works learn several tasks simultaneously [ 13, 21 , 86 ]. For
medical imaging, this can involve multiple modalities [ 72],
population centers [61], or anatomies [ 73 ]. However, the
tasks are always pre-determined by design: once trained,
each network can only solve tasks presented during training.
UniverSeg overcomes this limitation, enabling tasks to be
dynamically specified during inference.
