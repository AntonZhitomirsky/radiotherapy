\section{What is Radiotherapy?}

Clinicians use a system that uses high-resolution X-rays to produce contrasting images of cancerous tumours and surrounding soft tissue. Physicians then can target the cancerous tumour more precisely and decreasing radiation expsoure of healthy tissues \cite{radiotherapy-basic-concepts}.

Radiation therapy (radiotherapy) remains an improtant component of cancer treatment. In 2012 approximately 50\% of all cancer patients received radiation therapy, with an additional 40\% involving curative treatment \cite{radiotherapy-advances}.

\subsection{Cell Dealth}

Radiation-induced cell death is typically classified as interphase or proliferative death. Importantly, there is a consensus that cellular effects, including cell death, depend not only on radiation dose but cell type and a place in cell cycle \cite{cell-death}.

\subsubsection{Interphase death}

Cells cease to divide after radiation exposure and begin to die within hours. ``This is attributed to the damage of intercellular molecules and the activation of nuclease and proteolytic enzymes etc., after high doses of radiation, which leads to degradation [...]. Factors such as disruption of membrane structure and disorder of cell energy metabolism after irradiation are also important contributors to interphase death''\cite{cell-death}.

\subsubsection{Proliferative death}

Most cells undergo proliferative death after radiation. This results from ``mitotic catastrophe caused by accumulation of chromosomal aberrations and erroneous repair after radiation induces a DNA double-strand break [...] cells lose their ability to proliferate and begin to die.''\cite{cell-death}.

\subsection{Using Radiotherapy for Cancer}

Physicians use high-energy radiation to damage genetic material (deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA) of cells and thus block their ability to divide and proliferate further \cite{radiotherapy-advances}.

`In England, waiting times are getting worse each month â€“ over 1/3 of cancer patients (60,000) wait beyond the 62-day target, and 10,000 patients wait over 104 days'.

\section{Cervical Cancer}

In 2017, Cervical Cancer was the fourth most common malignancy diagnosed in women world wide \cite{cervical-cancer-epidemic}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item There are 530,000 new cases annaully, with 270,000 deaths \cite{cervical-cancer-epidemic}.
    \item approximately 85\% of cases occurr in underdeveloped or developing countries \cite{cervical-cancer-epidemic}
    \item The median age for diagnosis is 47 \cite{cervical-cancer-epidemic} which is by no means an end-of-life diagnosis, and many victims will still have a lot of time remaining after proper treatment.
    \item `The standard management of individuals with locally advanced cervical cancer includes external beam radiotherapy' \cite{cervical-cancer-epidemic}.
    \item `Scale-up of radiotherapy capacity in 2015-35 from current levels could lead to saving of 26.9 million life-years in low-income and middle-income countries over the lifetime of the patients who received treatment' \cite{expanding-global-access-to-radiotherapy}
\end{itemize}
