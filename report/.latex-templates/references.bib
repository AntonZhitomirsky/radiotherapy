  abstract = "AIMS: Target delineation uncertainty is arguably the largest
              source of geometric uncertainty in radiotherapy. Several factors
              can affect it, including the imaging modality used for
              delineation. It is accounted for by applying safety margins to
              the target to produce a planning target volume (PTV), to which
              treatments are designed. To determine the margin, the delineation
              uncertainty is measured as the delineation error, and then a
              margin recipe used. However, there is no published evidence of
              such analysis for recurrent gynaecological cancers (RGC). The
              aims of this study were first to quantify the delineation
              uncertainty for RGC gross tumour volumes (GTVs) and to calculate
              the associated PTV margins and then to quantify the difference in
              GTV, delineation uncertainty and PTV margin, between a computed
              tomography-magnetic resonance imaging (CT-MRI) and MRI workflow.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven clinicians delineated the GTV for 20
              RGC tumours on co-registered CT and MRI datasets (CT-MRI) and on
              MRI alone. The delineation error, the standard deviation of
              distances from each clinician's outline to a reference, was
              measured and the required PTV margin determined. Differences
              between using CT-MRI and MRI alone were assessed. RESULTS: The
              overall delineation error and the resulting margin were 3.1 mm
              and 8.5 mm, respectively, for CT-MRI, reducing to 2.5 mm and 7.1
              mm, respectively, for MRI alone. Delineation errors and therefore
              the theoretical margins, varied widely between patients. MRI
              tumour volumes were on average 15\% smaller than CT-MRI tumour
              volumes. DISCUSSION: This study is the first to quantify
              delineation error for RGC tumours and to calculate the
              corresponding PTV margin. The determined margins were larger than
              those reported in the literature for similar patients, bringing
              into question both current margins and margin calculation
              methods. The wide variation in delineation error between these
              patients suggests that applying a single population-based margin
              may result in PTVs that are suboptimal for many. Finally, the
              reduced tumour volumes and safety margins suggest that patients
              with RGC may benefit from an MRI-only treatment workflow.",

Comparing images to evaluate the quality of segmentation is an essential part of measuring progress in this research area. Some of the challenges in evaluating medical segmentation are: metric selection, the use in the literature of multiple definitions for certain metrics, inefficiency of the metric calculation implementations leading to difficulties with large volumes, and lack of support for fuzzy segmentation by existing metrics.},

 abstract={Many types of medical and scientific experiments acquire raw data in the form of images. Various forms of image processing and image analysis are used to transform the raw image data into quantitative measures that are the basis of subsequent statistical analysis. In this article we describe the SimpleITK R package. SimpleITK is a simplified interface to the insight segmentation and registration toolkit (ITK). ITK is an open source C++ toolkit that has been actively developed over the past 18 years and is widely used by the medical image analysis community. SimpleITK provides packages for many interpreter environments, including R. Currently, it includes several hundred classes for image analysis including a wide range of image input and output, filtering operations, and higher level components for segmentation and registration. Using SimpleITK, development of complex combinations of image and statistical analysis procedures is feasible. This article includes several examples of computational image analysis tasks implemented using SimpleITK, including spherical marker localization, multi-modal image registration, segmentation evaluation, and cell image analysis.},

              development and publication of numerous systems for
              auto-segmentation in radiotherapy. These systems have the
              potential to decrease contour variability, which has been
              associated with poor clinical outcomes and increased efficiency
              in the treatment planning workflow. However, there are no uniform
              standards for evaluating auto-segmentation platforms to assess
              their efficacy at meeting these goals. Here, we review the most
              frequently used evaluation techniques which include geometric
              overlap, dosimetric parameters, time spent contouring, and
              clinical rating scales. These data suggest that many of the most
              commonly used geometric indices, such as the Dice Similarity
              Coefficient, are not well correlated with clinically meaningful
              endpoints. As such, a multi-domain evaluation, including
              composite geometric and/or dosimetric metrics with
              physician-reported assessment, is necessary to gauge the clinical
              readiness of auto-segmentation for radiation treatment planning.",

  abstract = "Segmentation of organs and structures, as either targets or
              organs-at-risk, has a significant influence on the success of
              radiation therapy. Manual segmentation is a tedious and
              time-consuming task for clinicians, and inter-observer
              variability can affect the outcomes of radiation therapy. The
              recent hype over deep neural networks has added many powerful
              auto-segmentation methods as variations of convolutional neural
              networks (CNN). This paper presents a descriptive review of the
              literature on deep learning techniques for segmentation in
              radiation therapy planning. The most common CNN architecture
              across the four clinical sub sites considered was U-net, with the
              majority of deep learning segmentation articles focussed on head
              and neck normal tissue structures. The most common data sets were
              CT images from an inhouse source, along with some public data
              sets. N-fold cross-validation was commonly employed; however, not
              all work separated training, test and validation data sets. This
              area of research is expanding rapidly. To facilitate comparisons
              of proposed methods and benchmarking, consistent use of
              appropriate metrics and independent validation should be
              carefully considered.",

              Organs-At-Risks (OAR), given its potential in improving the
              efficiency of OAR contouring and reducing the inter- and
              intra-observer variabilities. The similar interests were shared
              for target volume segmentation, an essential step of radiation
              therapy treatment planning, where the gross tumor volume is
              defined and microscopic spread is encompassed. The deep
              learning-based automatic segmentation method has recently been
              expanded into target volume automatic segmentation. In this
              paper, the authors summarized the major deep learning
              architectures of supervised learning fashion related to target
              volume segmentation, reviewed the mechanism of each
              infrastructure, surveyed the use of these models in various
              imaging domains (including Computational Tomography with and
              without contrast, Magnetic Resonant Imaging and Positron Emission
              Tomography) and multiple clinical sites, and compared the
              performance of different models using standard geometric
              evaluation metrics. The paper concluded with a discussion of open
              challenges and potential paths of future research in target
              volume automatic segmentation and how it may benefit the clinical
              practice.",
